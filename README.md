# gcp-json-parse

v1.0 Beta - Parse output of a multi-lined JSON HTTP GCP data to csv - more formats to be added

v0.1 Alpha - Parses output of a single well-formatted JSON HTTP GCP data grab to stdout - DONE

gcp_http_parse.py is for Python 3.x, the other works on Python 2.x.  Plans to merge them in the next release.

Please ignore my garbage coding comments, there is a lot of stuff in there that I will be pulling out and optimizing in the finished product.
