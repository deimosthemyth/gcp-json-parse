# gcp-json-parse

v0.01 Alpha - Parses output of a single well-formatted JSON HTTP GCP data grab to stdout - DONE

v0.02 Alpha - Parse output of a multi-lined JSON HTTP GCP data to txt/csv (haven't decided, input welcome) - IN PROGRESS

Please ignore my garbage coding comments, there is a lot of stuff in there that I will be pulling out and optimizing in the finished product.
